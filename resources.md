## Learning Python
Python 3.x is our recommended language for technical interviews because of it's simplicity and brevity. 

*Don't bother with Python 2.x since it is outdated and soon to be unsupported.* 

We like Python because you can easily get a working Python program written without wasting time on overheads of instantiation, formatting, explicit typing, etc. that languages like Java are known for!

That being said - do NOT interview in a language you are not comfortable in. Choose a language which maximizes your ability to display your problem solving skills, one whose syntax/standard library you can use to your advantage.
