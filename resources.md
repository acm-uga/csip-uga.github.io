## Learning Python
Python 3.x is our recommended language for technical interviews because of it's simplicity and brevity. Don't bother with Python 2.x since it is outdated and soon to be unsupported. 
We like Python because you can easily get a working Python program written without wasting time on overheads of instantiation, formatting, explicit typing, etc. that languages like Java are known for!
That being said - do NOT interview in a language you are not comfortable in. Choose a language which maximizes your ability to display your problem solving skills, one whose syntax/standard library you can use to your advantage.
