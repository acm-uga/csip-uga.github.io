If you've attended a club meeting recently - you'll notice that we talk about Python ALOT. There's a good reason for this - it's an awesome language to interview in!

We usually get lots of questions on how to get up to speed with Python so we've created a guide on our new [Resources page](https://csip-uga.github.io/Resources/#learning-python)!

Our Resources page will act as a directory for learning materials we come across from online books to further coding practice.

We hope you enjoy and happy learning!
