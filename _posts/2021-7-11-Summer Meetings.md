We're happy to announce that we're continuing under UGA's chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery! 

We hope to continue to offer a place for technical interview practice, as well as other resume critiques, headshots, and more. 

If you're interested in joining our virtual summer sessions, find us on our Discord here:
